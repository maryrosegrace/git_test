        <h2>Typeset Choices</h2>
        <!--This is a hidden HTML comment-->
        <p>There are many diffrent typeset choices and they can be used to create many diffrent website feels.</p>
        <p>For example you can place emaphsis on a word by making the word <strong>bold</strong>.
        alternativly instead of making a word <strong>bold</strong>, you can put the word in <em>italics</em>.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that in orer to make a word <strong>bold</strong> the tag words is strong, and 
        to use <em>italics </em>the tag word is not a word at all, but only the letters e and m.</p>
